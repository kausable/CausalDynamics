# Challenge
CausalDynamics are constructed to solve the following dynamical causal challenges:
![Causal Challenges](docs/coupled-systems.png)

1️⃣ **Large Complex Graph**. Our algorithm allows users to generate arbitrarily large and complex graphs.

2️⃣ **Unobserved Confounder**. Represents partially observed or unresolved variables common in dynamical systems.

3️⃣ **Time-Lags**. Captures multi-scale temporal interactions. 

4️⃣ **Control for Varsortability**. Prevents ordering-based exploitation from algorithms.

5️⃣ **Flexible Drivers**. This includes functional (e.g., sinusoidal) or dynamical drivers (e.g., Lorenz system).
