# Benchmark
We provide overview of the methods used to generate our benchmark dataset here. More details on each dynamical class within the hierarchy can be found in:

- [Main Features](https://kausable.github.io/CausalDynamics/notebooks/features.html)
- [Simple Dynamics](https://kausable.github.io/CausalDynamics/notebooks/uncoupled_causal_models.html)
- [Coupled Dynamics](https://kausable.github.io/CausalDynamics/notebooks/coupled_causal_models.html)
- [Climate Dynamics](https://kausable.github.io/CausalDynamics/notebooks/climate_causal_models.html)

> **_NOTE:_** We provide several scripts to generate benchmark data for simple, coupled and climate models. Have a look at `scripts/README.md` for more information on how to run them.
