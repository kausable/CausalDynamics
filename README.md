CausalDynamics is a benchmark project designed to push the boundaries of causal discovery in complex dynamical systems.
It introduces a challenging suite of high-dimensional, noisy, and confounded dynamical environments.
These include thousands of coupled ordinary and stochastic differential equations, each grounded in known causal structures.
The benchmark evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art causal discovery methods under realistic conditions such as lagged dependencies and stochasticity that better reflect the nature of real-world systems.
Importantly, CausalDynamics supports a plug-and-play coupling workflow across component subsystems to construct a hierarchy of complexity.
The benchmark serves as a timely foundation for advancing the next generation of causal inference tools in scientific domains where dynamics are rich and interventions are rare.
