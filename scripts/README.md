# Miscellaneous scripts
We recommend running each script from the root directory, such that it looks like `python scripts/<python_script>.py --args[...]`. This is the list of scripts and their descriptions.

- `generate_simplex.py`: Generate dataset associated with uncoupled ODE/SDE systems
- `generate_coupled.py`: Generate dataset associated with coupled ODE/SDE systems
- `generate_climate.py`: Generate dataset associated with climate models, to be used in a plug-and-play fashion i.e., different coupling strategies
